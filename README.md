# z-dev-box

This is a [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/) box for Rails development that includes MySQL and other common dependencies.

This project is a modified fork of the [rails-dev-box](https://github.com/rails/rails-dev-box) by [@fxn](https://github.com/fxn). All the kudos to him.

## Requirements

You need to install:

1. [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org)

2. [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com)

## Usage

1. Build the virtual machine

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/jorgemanrubia/z-dev-box
    cd z-dev-box
    vagrant up
    ```

2. Clone the repo containing the code you want to edit inside the VM folder:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jorgemanrubia/some-repo.git
    ls # README.md puppet Vagrantfile some-repo
    ```

3. Now you can connect to the virtual machine and check the source code in the shared directory `/vagrant` mounted in the virtual box:

    ```bash
    vagrant ssh 
    ls /vagrant # README.md puppet Vagrantfile some-repo
    ```

The recommended workflow is

* Edit in the host computer, when you have your editor

* Test and run things in the virtual machine

## Box contents

It is a minimal Ubuntu (Precise Pangolin) containing:

* Git

* RVM

* Ruby 1.9.3 (binary RVM install)

* Bundler

* MySQL

* System dependencies for nokogiri, mysql, capybara-webkit and imagemagick
